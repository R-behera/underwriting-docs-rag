# Architecture

Underwriting Docs RAG is structured as a compact production-style starter:

1. `configs/project.json` stores project metadata, sample features, and a small local knowledge base.
2. `src/app/engine.py` holds the scoring, analysis, and retrieval logic.
3. `src/app/main.py` exposes FastAPI endpoints for scoring, analysis, and grounded querying.
4. `demo/index.html` provides a static executive demo for screenshots and repo previews.
5. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs a lightweight validation pass in CI.
